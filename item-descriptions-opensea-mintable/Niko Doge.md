### The DOGE Portrait

A portrait from the `Debris Art Collection` by 'Bəɹʤəɹɑn.  I've decided to include it in the Debris Collection because it will include ONE of the Shamir keys to the Debris vault.

This NFT is ultra high resolution 4000 x 2050 pixels at 300 DPI.  This size is suitable for printing.  There are no visible artifacts in the original work and the buyer can unlock content held within.

**Buyer Will Receive**

The original one of a kind digitally signed work • One Tenth of a Shamir Secret that unlocks a digital vault • A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) to prove authenticity and provenance of the work • A discreet, private, and direct communication vector and channel to the Artist • A shareable URL and QR Code for others to view a print of the original work.
